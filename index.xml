I began studying for the AZ-900 in November 2021, making usage of the Microsoft Learn resources provided for free, I chose to re-use the methods I used for my Security+ for this certification.</description></item><item><title>Blog: A Review of Mimo's Web Development Course</title><link>https://thomas-davey-sec.com/posts/mimo-web-dev-review/images/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 14:58:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://thomas-davey-sec.com/posts/mimo-web-dev-review/images/</guid><description>Mimo Web Development Path Review
