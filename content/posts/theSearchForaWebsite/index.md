After weeks of deliberation, I finally made the decision to start up a website. This will likely contain some little blogs and write-ups on various projects and milestones I work towards.  

The issue with making a personal website is one I’m sure many in my position face: For a software engineer it is TOO EASY. With so many options available to build a fantastic looking, dynamic website; with hosting, certificates, domains all covered in one cost it almost feels like cheating. If I didn’t spend all day writing code as a job it would be an easy option, but for an engineer it feels like taking the easy way.  

But then the issue with “The Hard Way” emerges. If I spend all day writing code for my job, why would I want to come home and write more of it for some personal anecdotes? It felt like a quick way to burn myself out having to write code anytime I wanted content. 

I quizzed some of my networks from university and was recommended Hugo. I checked it out, written in Go so already a plus with me. I quickly began reading the documentation and checking out how to use it. Perfect for my needs. 

Hugo allowed me to quickly set up a website without the need for any hard code, using MarkDown (.md) files for blogs and YAML for storing configuration & layout options. The framework provided a way for me to make exactly what I needed but without the feel of cheating that other website builders provided. The command line interface and syntax provided just the right amount of technical meat for me to sink my teeth into, without it becoming too much to bear. 

In short if you are also in the position I found myself in, wanting a website but not one too easy or too hard, definitely consider Hugo.
