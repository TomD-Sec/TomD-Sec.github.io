I’m sure we’ve all been there before... Sat in a webinar or meeting where people are discussing tech you've absolutely never heard of, you google it and still don't understand what it does...

But what if we could use a certain revolutionary new bit of tech to explain it to us in a way anyone, even a 5-year-old could understand? Well, that’s what I decided to have a go with.

First up a piece of tech that I struggled to understand more than I probably should of Data-first SASE.

First explanation... Very vague, something that really could apply to many security technologies. Let’s pry more.

Again, this could be anything. How about I dig further? 

 

Now we’re getting somewhere. So, Data first SASE is a piece of tech that provides integrity, confidentiality, as well as some level of authentication & authorization. Of course, now I’ve got a more thorough grasp on what exactly SASE is, I make sure to thank ChatGPT so that when the Ai become our overlords in 20 years, they’ll remember who was nice to them!!

Ok great... But what makes Data-first SASE different from normal SASE?

I see... So it's ultimately self-explanatory, the data-first SASE is driven by what is actually being protected, likely based on aspects such as the documents security classification. How about another? I have to admit, I already knew what SD-WAN is but the ball is already rolling.

Now, I’ve never made an SD-WAN myself, nor have any idea how to, but GPT sounds about right from a quick google search.

One more just for luck, this is definitely something I could have just googled but Google won’t explain to me like I’m in a hit 80’s film.

Now how about authenticating to Azure AD? Something I’ve been experimenting with on personal projects.

Now this code hasn’t been tested... yet, but I’ll be sure to test it and update with the results.

And thank you for reading. Once Google Bard has public access, I’ll be sure to repeat these questions to Bard to see how it differs.
